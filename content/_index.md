Welcome to my site.

I am a contemporary music composer, creating works for chamber ensembles- both instrumental and theatrical.

As a singer-songwriter and producer, I also create and release introspective experimental pop works under the name Mukura.

My research interests include phenomenology, musical creativity and spirituality, and the spiritual and psychological striving of 'voice'
