**Program Notes:**

**Ākāśā** represents the subtlest form of matter and is often described as the
infinite space in which all other elements exist, akin to a canvas upon which the
universe is painted. From this primordial element emerges all vibrations that become
Sound.
While waiting in line at a Shiva temple in South India, I was struck by the
multitude of sounds filling the vast space. Percussion instruments played different
rhythms in front of different deities, there was a melodic reed instrument, chants,
singing and bells. Voices of people conversing intertwined with this musical tapestry.
As the busy soundscape intensified, a sudden hush descended. From this silence
emerged a singular voice, singing in devotion, accompanied by the gentle flicker of a
flame lifted before the deity. In that moment, I transitioned from identifying with the
restless chaos to embracing the beauty that arose. But perhaps the truth lay in the
'space' in between the two. These aural experiences serve as an inspiration behind this
composition.

The first movement, "Exploration" depicts the movements of the Self within
Ākāśā. A Conch shell-like motif draws attention to the subtle space, as different
instruments weave their own melodies, and meander through space before
converging on the conch shell motif. The Self is represented by a recurring piano motif,
which in its final iteration surrenders to waves of string harmonics. In the second
movement, "Dance of Time" a cyclically repeating time structure emerges in 8/4,
anchored in a tala, symbolizing the Self’s entanglement in Time. The third movement,
"A Glimpse," features a brief polyrhythmic passage, with bell-like calls drowning out
the individual Self, offering a fleeting glimpse into something profound, beyond
mundane existence.
