Program Notes:


In Hindu mythology, the churning of the ocean is symbolic of the spiritual quest for eternal wisdom and bliss, with the ocean representing the subconscious mind. The process of churning is a complex psychological battle, much like being caught in the natural phenomena of whirlwinds which can plunge us into the ocean. But the ceaseless churning, much like the elegant, perpetual spinning of a whirling dervish, ultimately reveals a luminous essence of our Soul. The initial inspiration of this piece lay in these imagery.
The first movement (Whirlwinds) begins with frantic exchanges which herald the nascent whirlwind. Echoes of wind and waves evolve into relentless, linear, cyclical patterns among the 5 instruments. This movement also features a call-and-response interplay among the instrumentalists, reminiscent of Kalpana Swaram*, a South Indian Classical improvisation, with each instrument elaborating on the last musical statement. The movement seamlessly leads to the second movement (Ocean), a contemplative passage steered by the bass clarinet. The finale (Luminous), portrays the spontaneity and depth of the Soul, fusing composed and improvised sequences to express the innermost luminescence.

*Kalpana means imagination, Swaram refers to the Indian solfege.
