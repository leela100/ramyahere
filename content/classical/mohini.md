**Mohini: Layers of Illusions** is a pocket opera exploring the myth of Mohini and Brahmasuran

 {{< youtube rqlNV0FYE_4 >}}


**Program Notes:**

The Mahabharata is famous Indian epic that depicts the turn of Time into Kali Yuga, a time rife with falsity and deception. I adapted the libretto of Mohini: Layers of Illusions, from a short episode that occurs within this epic, which gives a glimpse into the layers of illusions, deceptions and philosophies that unfold throughout the larger narrative. In the music, I incorporated ragas and rhythms from Indian classical music, along with orchestration techniques to enhance the dramatic elements.

Brahmasura craves the illusion of power- first by accumulating spiritual strength, then by demanding a destructive boon. In his pursuit, he deceives Lord Shiva and, perhaps, himself. Later, he falls for the illusion of sensuality crafted by Mohini, who, in an act of deception, ultimately saves the world. Perhaps Time itself is the greatest illusion of all, giving rise to Maaya, a Neptunian veil that appears almost real.

The story can be viewed as an allegory of the different facets of our psyche, prompting us to contemplate ourselves and the world around us. Who is the Brahmasura within us, craving power? Who is Lord Shiva, that represents and recognises the divine potential in all? And who or what is Mohini? Are illusions distinct from deception, and does intention play a role? Ultimately, is everything determined by Time?


**Below is a short synopsis:**

Prologue and Scene I:
In the prologue, a demon named Brahmasura expresses regret for all that he has done through a deeply penitent aria. Scene I begins with his deep meditation on Lord Shiva, which lasts for many years. The Strings play the melody in the rhythm “Shivoham”, after which Lord Shiva appreciates his efforts and grants him a boon. Brahmasura, asks for the ability to turn anything he touches to ashes, a boon which Shiva grants reluctantly. Brahmasura then attempts to burn Shiva and chases him.

Scene II:
Time knows that the world needs rescuing from this game and sets about turning the wheel of events that must follow. Time compels the worldly-wise Lord Vishnu to take the alluring form of Mohini. In a polyphonic duet between Time and Mohini, they distract and tempt Brahmasura away from Lord Shiva. In the aria ‘Dance of Deception’, Mohini seduces him to dance with her, mirroring her own movements, and tricks him into placing his hand upon himself.

Scene III:
Scene 3 features reflections from various characters, accompanied by modified musical motifs from earlier scenes. Lord Shiva mourns the squandering of Brahmasura's potential, which could have altered the trajectory of his soul. Mohini, on the other hand, questions whether her deceptive methods make her equivalent to Brahmasura, despite her intentions to save the world, and contemplates whether she should have attempted to change him instead. The opera concludes with the musings and questions of Time, the ultimate weaver of these illusions.
