Program Notes:


Gurdjieff was an Armenian mystic-philosopher and teacher. Like other
mystics, he recognized the presence of multiple ego centers or "I's" within an
individual. Different 'I's dominate a person's consciousness based on situations and
their habitual reactions and routines. Gurdjieff's unique way was to use deliberate
surprises, shocks and challenges that seemed absurd at first glance. His objective was
to jolt students from their routine, automatic behaviours, and get them to pay attention
to and watch their thoughts. He also spoke about the three core centers of our being:
Intellectual, emotional and instinctive centers, and incorporated movement and
dances to get in touch with these centers in the body and increase self-awareness.
This piece is a non-serious take on his methods. The first movement (The many
I's) depicts the habitual Selves, and the shocks and jolts that are absurd and quirky
and reveal newer Selves. In the second movement (A Sacred Dance), musical phrases
play with the cyclic notion of time, from which emerges a short sacred dance.
