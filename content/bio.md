Born and raised in India, **Ramya Thiyagarajan** is a composer, vocalist, and ethnomusicologist whose work explores the intersections of experimental sound, Indian classical traditions, and contemporary narrative forms. Originally trained as an engineer, she transitioned into music after discovering a deep pull toward composition and voice—eventually studying at KM Music Conservatory in Chennai and earning an MA in Music Composition and Ethnomusicology from Hunter College, New York City. She is also a trained Carnatic classical vocalist.

Ramya’s original compositions span experimental pop, Carnatic arrangements, and contemporary classical works. Her EP Onward and Backward, released under the artist name **Mukura**, blends introspective songwriting with pop, Indian classical elements, and electronic textures. Her follow-up single Dheere Dheere Re Mana, a meditative setting of Kabir Das’s poetry, was featured on Spotify’s “Incoming Indie” editorial playlist.

Her chamber opera Mohini: Layers of Illusions, based on the Mohini–Brahmasura myth, premiered at Hunter College in 2024 and draws from raga-based motifs within a Western classical framework. Other works like Ākāśā, Whirlwinds of our Soul, and Gurdjieff’s Mischief explore philosophical themes through varied orchestral textures.

She has performed with A.R. Rahman’s chamber choir in major productions and with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra as part of Celtic Connections. She has also presented Carnatic concerts at iconic venues such as the Kapaleeswarar Temple in Chennai. Her recent work has been supported by fellowships and residencies including the Louise Talma Endowed Fellowship, the Alda Artist Award, and Wildflower Composer Labs. She currently resides in Jersey City.
