<h1 style="color: teal;"> Experimental Pop Works </h1>

 The songs released as Mukura are introspective and self-reflexive, and sung, composed and produced by me. The lyrics are also written by me, or drawn from poetry that inspires me. I consider these to be genre-fluid, though they use electronic sounds, electro pop elements as well as Indian classical elements.
